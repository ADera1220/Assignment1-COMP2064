<p>This assignment's allowance to use outside frameworks inspired me to attempt a React.js site in conjunction with Node/Express.js. The idea of combining both was interesting so I looked it up and have provided a link to the walkthrough for connection below.</p>

<p>Putting the page together required help from Bootstrap and a sister package for react called "React-Bootstrap", once installed, this helped me creat dynamic layouts easily, however, I learned a new quirk for react in regards to media. You cannot simply link to media via a relative path, it must instead be imported as a variable and then passed into the Component as such.</p>

<p>After some trouble with linking and compounding errors with the routing. I decided to restart the project under the original requirements of using express generator and Handlebars, I will keep the original Repository linked here as it shows my progress on this assignment, even if none of the code makes it into the final section.</p>
